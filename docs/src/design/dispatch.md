##### __Positional Signatures__

###### _each approach subsumes 64 signatures_

- With 2 keyword args, there are 4 positional signatures (one for each state shown in [approach](approach.md)).
- With the 4 data configurations that becomes 4x4 = 16 signatures.
- With the 3 ways to weight + unweighted this gives 16x4 = 64 signatures.
