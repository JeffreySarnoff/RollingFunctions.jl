This package supports distinct approaches to appling a 
moving window function over data sequences.
The core design develops each approach in the same way.
This simplifies development, mitigates unexpected corner cases,
and improves reliability.

There are three approachs: 
[`running`](..\approach\running.md), 
[`tiling`](..\approach\tiling.md), and 
[`rolling`](..\approach\rolling.md).

We use two keyword arguments, both are optional:
[`padding`](..\approach\padding.md), and 
[`atend`](..\approach\atend.md).

This allows three call states for each approach
```
<approach>(windowed_fn, window_width, data_seq)
<approach>(windowed_fn, window_width, data_seq; padding=pad)
<approach>(windowed_fn, window_width, data_seq; padding=pad, atend=true)
```

For every approach, there are four data configurations:

- one vector
- two vectors (of equal length)
- three vectors (of equal length)
- a matrix of 2 or more columns

For every approach, the data sequence may be weighted. 
There are three ways to introduce weights:

- _for any data configuration_
  - as a vector where isa(vector, StatsBase.AbstractWeights)
- _for multiple data sequences or a data matrix_
  - as a vector where isa(vector, Vector{<:StatsBase.AbstractWeights})
  - as a matrix where isa(matrix, <:Matrix{Number})
